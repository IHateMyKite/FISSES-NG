# FileAccess Interface for Skyrim SE Scripts (FISSES) GOG Edition

My fork of Terence Yao's FISSES 1.4.1 code, with a few simple changes to get it working with the current Skyrim GOG edition (GOG branch of SKSE 2.2.3 / Skyrim game version 1.6.659).

I sourced Terence's code from https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13956?tab=files. Namely the file "FISSES DLL Source Code 2022-09-25" under the section "Miscellaneous Files". I understand that code was used for the most recent compiled mod, which is also listed on that page as "FileAccess Interface for Skyrim SE Scripts - FISSES (Anniversary Edition) BETA" (v1.4.1), with a description of "Re-build source code for SKSE64 Preliminary AE build 2.2.2. Compatible only with SkyrimSE.exe 1.6.640."

Terence Yao is, of course, the original creator of this mod. I have not attempted to do major rewrites or bug fixes of Terence's code - just to get it working with the GOG version of Skyrim.
